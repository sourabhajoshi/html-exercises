<!-- Scenario: Creating an Online Article with Different Text Formats
You're tasked with writing an online article for a news website about the latest breakthrough in quantum computing. The article should include various text formatting elements to enhance readability and emphasize key points. It should be easy to scan and visually engaging for readers.

Article Structure:
Title: The article's headline, making it bold and attention-grabbing.

Introduction: A short introductory paragraph about the topic.

Key Takeaways: The main points of the article, formatted using bold or italicized text to highlight important aspects.

Quotes: Include a famous quote from an expert in the field, using the <blockquote> tag and other formatting tags like italic.

Technical Information: Display some mathematical formulas or chemical reactions, using subscript and superscript.

Important Definitions: Use the <mark> tag to highlight important terms like "quantum entanglement."

Old vs. New Information: Show a comparison of outdated vs. current theories using deleted and inserted text.

Conclusion: A brief conclusion with the author's final thoughts, including emphasized text for key points.

Task: Create the Article Using HTML Formatting Elements
Your task is to use the following HTML formatting elements in the article:

Bold (<b> and <strong>): To emphasize important sections like the title or major points.

Italic (<i> and <em>): To highlight quotes or terms that need emphasis.

Marked (<mark>): To highlight important terms or keywords.

Smaller (<small>): To provide less prominent details (such as a disclaimer or less important information).

Deleted (<del>) and Inserted (<ins>): To demonstrate changes over time or outdated vs. new information.

Subscript (<sub>) and Superscript (<sup>): For scientific or mathematical representations (such as formulas, chemical equations, or references to power notation). -->

            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
